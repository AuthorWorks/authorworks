//! Request handlers module
//! 
//! This module re-exports handler utilities. The actual handlers are in lib.rs
//! to keep the code organized while maintaining compatibility with Spin's
//! component model.

// Handler utilities are implemented directly in lib.rs
// This module exists for future expansion if handlers need to be split out
